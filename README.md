Yeah I'm just coding this for fun.
I've been messing around with a couple diffferent libraries (pytorch, sklearn, statsmodels) 
and want to put them all into a project and see if I can get it to work

So I got a traffic data set off of kaggle and I want to see how well I can predict traffic using a couple different indicators
I also spend some time comparing different parameters on various models. 

Its not super clean, because it is more just for my own enjoyment
