About Dataset
Traffic congestion and related problems are a common concern in urban areas. 
Understanding traffic patterns and analyzing data can provide valuable insights 
for transportation planning, infrastructure development, and congestion management.

What exactly is this dataset and how was it created?
it is a valuable resource for studying traffic conditions as it contains 
information collected by a computer vision model. The model detects four 
classes of vehicles: cars, bikes, buses, and trucks. The dataset is stored 
in a CSV file and includes additional columns such as time in hours, date, 
days of the week, and counts for each vehicle type (CarCount, BikeCount, 
BusCount, TruckCount). The "Total" column represents the total count of 
all vehicle types detected within a 15-minute duration.

The dataset is updated every 15 minutes, providing a comprehensive view of 
traffic patterns over the course of one month. Additionally, the dataset 
includes a column indicating the traffic situation categorized into four 
classes: 1-Heavy, 2-High, 3-Normal, and 4-Low. This information can help 
assess the severity of congestion and monitor traffic conditions at different 
times and days of the week.
